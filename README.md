Java CLI Calculator

A small Java project made to showcase basic development skills. It is expansible by design, and I plan on adding more functionality in the future, just to see how far I can take it (apart from making a GUI).

Every command is accessible by entering the character between parentheses, i.e: "(A)dd". You only need to enter the letter "A" or "a", and this is done so the program is actually useable for longer operations.
